# Introduction 
Sorting Algorithms can vary greatly by: 
- Runtime
- Memory usage
- Comparison versus non-comparison 
- Stability 

We ask: 

How do these characteristics affect sorting algorithmsâ€™ ability to be parallelized or accelerated? 

Is there a pattern to which algorithms are most able to be parallelized (CPUs) or accelerated (GPUs)? 

Our work explores possible answers to these questions. 


# Requirements
- GNU GCC Compiler (We used 10.2)
- NVIDIA HPC SDK Compiler (We used 21.7)
- OpenACC
- OpenMP 
- Multicore System with at least one GPU
